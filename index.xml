      <description>We just release Zellij 0.32.0 with lots of exciting features and improvements.
In this version, we emphasized features geared toward advanced users. We feel Zellij already provides a great experience to users new to terminal multiplexers, and would now like to make configuring and personalizing the tool easier. We want to grant power users the ability to better harness their terminal workspace, expressing their imagination and sharing their findings with the community.</description>

      <description>We just released Zellij 0.23.0, which adds collaboration features to our terminal multiplexer.
This solution allows multiple users to be attached to the same Zellij session and each have their own cursor. The cursors appear in different colors, giving a Google-docs like experience in the terminal and allowing users to be focused not only on different tabs, but on different panes in the same tab. That way they can see each other type in real time.</description>

      <description>Zellij is a terminal workspace. It has the base functionality of a terminal multiplexer (similar to tmux or screen) but includes many built-in features that would allow users to extend it and create their own personalized environment.
Split the terminal into different panes and tabs Like other multiplexers, Zellij allows users to split their terminal into different panes and tabs:
 Layout Engine Zellij includes a layout engine, allowing users to define a map of panes in a yaml file and load it when they start the app.</description>

      <description>var playerElement = document.getElementById(&#34;player-wrapper&#34;); var player = new Clappr.Player({ source: &#34;/video/basic-development-screencast.mp4&#34;, mute: false, height: 540, width: 960 }); player.attachTo(playerElement);  This tutorial demonstrates some basic features of Zellij through a real world use-case of using the terminal for development.
You need not be a terminal developer to benefit from this tutorial.
The video screencast and the tutorial contain the same content.
What we&amp;rsquo;ll cover  Opening New Panes Using Floating Panes Starting Command Panes from the CLI Editing Pane Scrollback with your own $EDITOR  Getting Started  We&amp;rsquo;ll use a basic Rust project as an example, but it can work with any sort of code.</description>

      <description>Basic Functionality + Floating Panes + Command Panes + Scrollback Editing   Here we demonstrate some of the more basic functionality of Zellij and terminal multiplexers in general.
We&amp;rsquo;ll show how to open multiple terminal tiled and floating panes.
Instead of retyping a command or searching through our shell history, we&amp;rsquo;ll see how we can use Command Panes to keep frequently run commands around. Finally, we&amp;rsquo;ll talk about editing a pane&amp;rsquo;s scrollback with our own $EDITOR</description>
